## Overview

The deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) community in India relies on Indian Sign Language (ISL) for communication, but most public spaces — hospitals, schools, offices — have no way to interpret it. Existing solutions either require expensive hardware (sensor gloves, depth cameras) or only work in English.

This system bridges that gap using a standard webcam. It detects 25 common ISL hand gestures in real time, constructs meaningful English sentences from detected signs, and translates the output into Kannada or Hindi — no specialized hardware required.

**Key numbers:**
- 25 custom gesture classes trained from scratch
- mAP@0.50 of ~1.0 across all classes (near-perfect detection)
- mAP@0.50:0.95 ranging from 0.79 to 0.95 (strong localization)
- Real-time inference at 15–25 FPS on standard consumer hardware
- Stable operation confirmed over 30-minute continuous sessions
- 11% plagiarism similarity score (DrillBit certified)

## Demo

The system detects gestures frame-by-frame, buffers confirmed words, builds a sentence, and translates it on demand.

**Example flows:**

| Gestures Performed | English Sentence | Kannada Translation |
|:-------------------|:-----------------|:--------------------|
| your → home → play | "your home play" | ನಿಮ್ಮ ಮನೆ ಆಟ |
| now → go → home | "now go home" | ಈಗ ಮನೆಗೆ ಹೋಗು |
| my → teacher → happy | "my teacher happy" | ಮೇರೇ ಶಿಕ್ಷಕ ಖುಷ |
| we → like → fruit | "we like fruit" | हमें फल पसंद है |

---

## Features

- **Real-time gesture detection** — YOLOv8 runs inference on every webcam frame with bounding boxes and confidence scores
- **Temporal smoothing** — a word is only added to the sentence after being detected consistently across multiple frames, eliminating flicker and false positives
- **Sentence construction** — sequential gestures are buffered and joined into coherent English sentences; duplicate words are filtered automatically
- **Multilingual translation** — completed sentences translate to Kannada or Hindi via the Deep Translator API
- **Interactive PyQt5 dashboard** — live video feed, detected words, formed sentence, and translation output all in one interface
- **Lightweight deployment** — runs on Intel i3 + 4 GB RAM; no GPU required for inference
- **Session logging** — optional saving of detection logs and sentences for review or dataset expansion

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- pip
- A webcam (USB or built-in)
- Windows 10/11 or Ubuntu 18.04+

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rupin2207/isl-to-regional-text.git
cd isl-to-regional-text

# 2. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Download the trained model weights
# Place best.pt in the /weights directory
# (Download link in releases or contact the team)
```

### `requirements.txt`

```
ultralytics>=8.0.0
opencv-python>=4.7.0
PyQt5>=5.15.0
torch>=1.13.0
torchvision>=0.14.0
numpy>=1.23.0
Pillow>=9.0.0
deep-translator>=1.9.0
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run the main application
python main.py
```
![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rupin2207/IndianSignLanguageToRegionalTextUsingYOLOv8/main/results/newresu.jpg)
**Dashboard controls:**

| Button | Action |
|:-------|:-------|
| Start | Activates webcam and begins real-time detection |
| Stop | Pauses the video feed |
| Clear Sentence | Resets the word buffer and sentence display |
| Translate | Sends the formed English sentence to the translation module |
| Exit | Closes the application and releases camera resources |

**How to use it:**
1. Click **Start** — the camera feed appears with live bounding boxes
2. Perform ISL gestures one at a time in front of the camera
3. Hold each gesture steady — the scanning counter (e.g., 3/5) confirms detection before adding the word
4. Watch the sentence build in the "Formed Sentence" field
5. Select a target language (Kannada / Hindi) from the dropdown
6. Click **Translate** to see the regional language output

## Supported Gestures

The model is trained on 25 custom ISL word classes:

| | | | | |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| book | drink | eat | friend | fruit |
| go | happy | he | home | I |
| like | my | name | now | park |
| play | read | school | she | teacher |
| tired | today | we | you | your |

> To add new gestures: collect and annotate images using LabelImg (YOLO format), retrain with the provided `train.py` script, and replace `best.pt` with the new weights.

## Model Performance

### Detection vs. Localization Precision (Top 10 Classes)

| Class | mAP@0.50 (Detection) | mAP@0.50:0.95 (Localization) |
|:------|:--------------------:|:----------------------------:|
| play | 1.0 | ~0.83 |
| read | 1.0 | ~0.91 |
| school | 1.0 | ~0.93 |
| she | 1.0 | ~0.94 |
| teacher | 1.0 | ~0.78 |
| tired | 1.0 | ~0.79 (lowest) |
| today | 1.0 | ~0.90 |
| we | 1.0 | ~0.84 |
| you | 1.0 | ~0.83 |
| your | 1.0 | ~0.92 |

**Key observations:**
- mAP@0.50 is 1.0 across all tested classes — the model always identifies the correct sign
- Localization precision (mAP@0.50:0.95) is the harder metric; "tired" scores lowest (~0.79) due to bounding box imprecision, not misclassification
- The confusion matrix shows a strong diagonal with near-zero off-diagonal entries, confirming minimal class confusion

### Non-Functional Performance

| Metric | Target | Achieved |
|:-------|:------:|:--------:|
| Inference FPS | ≥ 15 | 15–25 FPS |
| Translation latency | < 1 second | ✅ |
| Continuous runtime stability | 30 minutes | ✅ No crashes |
| Confidence threshold for word acceptance | > 80% | ✅ |
